                    <div class="aboutmetext">I'm 23 years old and I live in a small Illinois suburb called Wood Dale. I graduated the University of Iowa in 2020 with a bachelors degree in Liberal Arts & Sciences. My bachelors includes a major in Cinema and a minor in Music. While at school I also learned American Sign Language (ASL) and have five years of experience. I took a few coding classes as well, including Introduction to Computer Science, where we learned how to code in python. Currently I am enrolled in the online coding bootcamp, devCodeCamp. The image to the left is me riding my friend's moped with absolute grace. </div>

                    <div class="projectstext">I'm a huge fan of horror films, and one key element to any film that can make or break it is the music. The soundtrack is something that is usually overlooked when a movie is brought up. However, think of your favorite film. Now think of that same film if it didn't have any music. Would it give off the same effect? Probably not. Since I love horror films and I love music production, I made an album of only dark ambient tracks. </div>
